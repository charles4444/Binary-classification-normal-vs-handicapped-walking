# Binary-classification-normal-vs-handicapped-walking

A binary classification machine learning algorithm to distinguish between a normal and a handicapped walking person

The goal of this binary classification ML algorithm is to distinguish between a normal walking person and a person, who is walking with a handicap, in this case a small plastic object in his/her shoe. The data was collected with wearable inertial sensors, connected with a custom build smartphone app.

This project took place in the class "Computational Intelligence in Engineering" by Prof. Bernd Markert and assisted by Arnd Koeppe and Marion Mundt at the Institute of General Mechanics at RWTH Aachen University. The Code was written in a team consisting of Vivek Chavan (Github: @Vivek9Chavan), Ahmet KÃ¼peli (Github: @KuepeliAhmet) and myself.

I specially want to thank Arnd Koeppe and Marion Mundt for assisting in the project and want to redirect to their research for further reading.
